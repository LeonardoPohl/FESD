\chapter{Results}
\label{sec:results}
% again appendix
In this chapter, the results of the experiments are presented. The results for each different problem sets are presented separately. Note that the HPE error detection task can be seen as a classification task, where an error, e.g. an erroneous joint, is considered positive and no error is considered negative. Therefore, a result is considered as a "True Positive", if the ground truth label of a joint is equal to "Error" and the predicted value of that joint is also equal to "Error". Models which suffered from neural collapse are omitted to reduce confusion.

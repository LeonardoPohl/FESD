\section{Recording Setup}

Multiple iterations of the recording process were run to find the best possible setup, which reduces the light interference as much as possible and which offers the best results with the resources at hand. The camera setup that is used by SilverFit was reproduced. At SilverFit the camera is mounted at $175cm$ above the floor. The camera that is used has an accelerometer which was used to adjust the camera angle relative to the ground. The camera is angled downward at a $70^\circ$ angle. To record the dataset an Intel Realsense L515 camera was used. Additionally, for the preliminary analysis of errors an Orbbec Astra+ and a Microsoft Kinect v2 were used.

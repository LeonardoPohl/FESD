# Laughing Eureka

This repository hopefully contains the last, but successful attempt at implementing my thesis. In this iteration I am using the OpenNi framework to simultaneously stream different cameras. So far it has shown to be quite promising at least for the astra cameras. Even if the Realsense camera does not work with the OpenNi framework I am still hopefull that this might be my last attempt, since the Realsense library is easier to work with than the Astra library.

## Installation

To use the code in this repository some things have to be installed, this might not be a complete list.

- Astra Driver
- Realsense Driver

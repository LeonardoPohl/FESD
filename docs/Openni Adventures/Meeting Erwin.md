- Started reading review
- Want to start finishing my thesis
- New scope maybe:
	- The effect of multi modal cameras on the 2 most promising
		- Template Based Methods
		- Feature Based Methods
		- Machine Learning based models
	- How many recordings should I create?
	- How much overlap should there be between cameras?
	- Some methods improve using multiple frames how should I consider this in the measurement?
		- Should single frame performance be important?
			- Most RGB-D applications are not still images
		- Should I use the average accuracy?
		- Should I use a delayed average for the methods that improve over time?

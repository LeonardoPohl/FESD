    abstract    = {In this work, we carry out a study of the effect of adverse conditions, which characterize real-world scenes, on the accuracy of a Convolutional Neural Network applied to 3D object class recognition. Firstly, we discuss possible ways of representing 3D data to feed the network. In addition, we propose a set of representations to be tested. Those representations consist of a grid-like structure (fixed and adaptive) and a measure for the occupancy of each cell of the grid (binary and normalized point density). After that, we propose and implement a Convolutional Neural Network for 3D object recognition using Caffe. At last, we carry out an in-depth study of the performance of the network over a 3D CAD model dataset, the Princeton ModelNet project, synthetically simulating occlusions and noise models featured by common RGB-D sensors. The results show that the volumetric representations for 3D data play a key role on the recognition process and Convolutional Neural Network can be considerably robust to noise and occlusions if a proper representation is chosen.}

abstract={Robot detection, recognition, positioning, and other applications require not only real-time video image information but also the distance from the target to the camera, that is, depth information. This paper proposes a method to automatically generate any monocular camera depth map based on RealSense camera data. By using this method, any current single-camera detection system can be upgraded online. Without changing the original system, the depth information of the original monocular camera can be obtained simply, and the transition from 2D detection to 3D detection can be realized. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, a hardware system was constructed using the Micro-vision RS-A14K-GC8 industrial camera and the Intel RealSense D415 depth camera, and the depth map fitting algorithm proposed in this paper was used to test the system. The results show that, except for a few depth-missing areas, the results of other areas with depth are still good, which can basically describe the distance difference between the target and the camera. In addition, in order to verify the scalability of the method, a new hardware system was constructed with different cameras, and images were collected in a complex farmland environment. The generated depth map was good, which could basically describe the distance difference between the target and the camera.},

abstract={Today, enhancement in sensing technology enables the use of multiple sensors to track human motion/activity precisely. Tracking human motion has various applications, such as fitness training, healthcare, rehabilitation, human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and activity recognition. Therefore, the fusion of multiple sensors creates new opportunities to develop and improve an existing system. This paper proposes a pose-tracking system by fusing multiple three-dimensional (3D) light detection and ranging (lidar) and inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors. The initial step estimates the human skeletal parameters proportional to the target user's height by extracting the point cloud from lidars. Next, IMUs are used to capture the orientation of each skeleton segment and estimate the respective joint positions. In the final stage, the displacement drift in the position is corrected by fusing the data from both sensors in real time. The installation setup is relatively effortless, flexible for sensor locations, and delivers results comparable to the state-of-the-art pose-tracking system. We evaluated the proposed system regarding its accuracy in the user's height estimation, full-body joint position estimation, and reconstruction of the 3D avatar. We used a publicly available dataset for the experimental evaluation wherever possible. The results reveal that the accuracy of height and the position estimation is well within an acceptable range of {\textpm}3-5 cm. The reconstruction of the motion based on the publicly available dataset and our data is precise and realistic.},

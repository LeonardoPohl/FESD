\chapter{Data Processing}
\label{sec:data_processing}

In this chapter, we discuss the data processing steps that are required to prepare the data for the model development process. Firstly, we address different session parameters and how they might influence the data. Secondly, we explain the data acquisition process and how the data is stored in files such that it can be used in the future. Thirdly, we discuss the data population process in which the human pose data is extracted from the raw data. To ensure the quality of the dataset we then evaluate the data by filtering invalid skeletons and marking data points as valid or invalid. Finally, we discuss the data augmentation process in which the data is augmented to increase the size of the dataset.

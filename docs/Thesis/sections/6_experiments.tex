\section{Experiments}

Experiments have to be conducted to gain some insight into the performance of the current system, and a comparison to the improvement and other systems. Also the fault detection should be experimented with

\subsection{Fault detection}

Calculate F1-score, but false positives and false negatives are also important individually, maybe it is not in the best interest to bother the customer constantly because the system detects non existing faults.

\subsection{Model Comparison}



\subsubsection{Metrics}

A number of metrics should be taken into consideration, to get the most accurate evaluation.

\paragraph{Accuracy}

Mean square error.

\paragraph{Performance}

Calculation time and maybe memory consumption, to have a low performance footstep.

To improve the quality of FESDModel, more data needs to be collected and labelled in different settings. 

% There are a multiple areas in which FESD can be expanded. Firstly, FESDData is already quite stable and user friendly software, however, as any software it can be improved. Firstly, the file storage is efficient enough for data recording but it is prone to error and can easily be interrupted by a corrupt file. In a future, more stable version of FESDData storing each recording in a separate RosBag file would improve the stability of the file system. Additionally, $REPLACE_WE$ have not fixed some edge case issues which were not essential to the thesis itself.

% The developed model could be improved by increasing the training data and recording in different settings. To further validate the model $REPLACE_WE$ could imagine applying it to a different dataset that is used by an action detector and evaluating its performance with introduced errors. Additionally, $REPLACE_WE$ could derive with a model which not only determines if there is an error, but also tries to fix the error by suggesting a different location.

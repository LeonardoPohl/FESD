\section{Data Evaluation}


%Next, we evaluate the recorded data and especially the detected skeleton. We focus specifically on the joints with a low confidence value. Since we have the skeleton data from two perspectives at the same time, we can compare the 3D coordinates of both streams. If we notice a missing joint, we can estimate its position using the same joint of the other stream, provided it has a relatively high confidence value. In other cases, we can improve the calculated skeleton, by forming a weighted average of the 3D coordinates based on the confidence of each Joint. Another step might be to update the 2D Coordinates of the skeleton but we might just leave that for future work. % TODO, will this be future work or should we do it now?

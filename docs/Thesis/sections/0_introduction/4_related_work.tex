A plethora of methods have been developed to estimate the pose of a human. In this section, we will discuss some of the methods that have been developed to estimate the pose of a human. Additionally, we discuss datasets that have been developed to test the performance of the methods. Finally, we discuss some of the methods that have been developed to estimate the fault.

\subsection{RGBD Pose-Datasets}

\subsection{Fault Estimation}

So far I have found no research regarding fault estimation.

\section{Data population}

%Thirdly, to achieve the highest framerate, we calculate the skeleton based on the recorded data and add it to the dataset in a separate step. The RGB stream is used to create the dataset for the skeleton detection and the depth stream is used to create the point clouds for the calculation of global skeleton points. We store both the local 2D coordinates in accordance with the image used for the skeleton detection, as well as the global 3D coordinates based on the aligned point clouds. Additionally, OpenPose provides us with a confidence score for each joint.

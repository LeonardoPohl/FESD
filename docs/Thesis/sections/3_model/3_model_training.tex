\section{Model training}
\label{sec:model_training}

Using this enlarged dataset, we can train a Neural Network to recognise faults in the data. We use the depth data as input, the skeleton data as input, and a combination of both as input. We also experiment with different network layouts, such as a fully connected network, a convolutional network, and a combination of both. We use the augmented data to train the model and the manually checked ground truth to validate the model. We use the validation data to determine the best model and the best network layout. We use the best model to predict the faults in the data. 

\subsection{Data preparation}

I guess this is the part where I should explain how the data is prepared for training. I think I should explain the data augmentation and the data splitting. I should also explain how the data is prepared for the different network layouts.

\section{Camera}

In this section, we discuss the difficulties that can occur due to the camera. SilverFit uses a predefined camera setup, which is the same for every customer. This setup is tried and tested and has been used for many years. However, the camera setup can still cause difficulties during human pose estimation. Furthermore, we also discuss more general difficulties that can occur with any camera setup.

The two main difficulties that can occur with the camera are the camera position and the camera angle.

\section{Future work}

\begin{itemize}
  \item More stability in software (it is actually quite stable already but adding tests and ensuring adequate error handling would make it enterprise grade)
  \item Save everything in a single rosbag file and write a rosbag reader
  \item Multithreaded Streaming and recording (would probably not work since memory would be bottle neck)
  \item More data more variation in session parameters
  \item Different exercises
  \item Joint Reconstruction
  \item Attempt to fix error
  \item Import model using ONNX 
  \item Use trained model in SilverFit
  \item Train model with different HPE algorithms and use model to decide when to use which
\end{itemize}

\section{Future work}

\begin{itemize}
  \item More stability in software (it is actually quite stable already but adding tests and ensuring adequate error handling would make it generally usable) (I also have a lot of ideas for this but I will not write them here, maybe ill name some in the report)
  \item Save everything in a single rosbag file and write a custom rosbag reader
  \item Multithreaded Streaming and recording (would probably not work since memory would be bottle neck, especially to a single file this would be a problem)
  \item More data more variation in session parameters
  \item Different exercises
  \item Joint Reconstruction
  \item Attempt to fix detected error
  \item Import model using ONNX 
  \item Use trained model in SilverFit
  \item Train model with different HPE algorithms and use model to decide when to use which
\end{itemize}

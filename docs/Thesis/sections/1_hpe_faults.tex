\chapter{Human Pose Estimation Difficulties}
\label{sec:errors}

In this chapter, we discuss possible faults and difficulties that occur during human pose estimation. These difficulties are caused by different factors, such as the environment, the camera, the person, and the software. We discuss the most common difficulties and how they can be addressed. 

These difficulties are important to understand, as they can cause the joints to be in the incorrect position or missing.

\chapter{Challenges in Human Pose Estimation}
\label{sec:errors}
% include this in the dataset section rather
% cahllenges are already mentioned in the introduction so no need to go into detail here
In this chapter, possible faults and difficulties that occur during human pose estimation are discussed. These difficulties are caused by different factors, such as the environment, the camera, the person, and the software. 

These difficulties are important to understand, as they can cause the joints to be in the incorrect position or missing. This can cause the pose estimation to be incorrect, and therefore, the human-computer interaction will be hampered.

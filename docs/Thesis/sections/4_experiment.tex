\chapter{Experiment and Results}

\section{Experiment}
\label{sec:experiment}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Cameras and how REPLACE_WE used them
  \item The recording process
  \item Evaluation process evaluation, how many recordings were labeled
  \item How much data was used for training and how much for testing
  \item What hardware was used
  \item How many epochs, what training rate and all those parameters
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}

\begin{itemize}
  \item What results are REPLACE_WE expecting and why
  \item Graphs with different metrics
  
\begin{itemize}
    \item Confusion matrix for each difficulty
    \item Each metric mentioned in model evaluation
\end{itemize}

  \item Evaluation and explaination of the graphs
  \item Have REPLACE_WE achieved what REPLACE_WE were looking for?
\end{itemize}

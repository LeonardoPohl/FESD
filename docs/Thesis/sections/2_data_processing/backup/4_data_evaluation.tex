\section{Data Evaluation}
\label{sec:data_evaluation}

Next, $REPLACE_WE$ evaluate the recorded data and especially the detected skeleton. $REPLACE_WE$ focus specifically on the joints with a low confidence value. 

We discard frames with lacking pose data from the training dataset, they are not usable to train a model. $REPLACE_WE$ might still use it for the testing phase. If $REPLACE_WE$ notice that the dataset is getting too small, $REPLACE_WE$ might re-record some sessions.

\textit{\textbf{QUESTION} Should I discard frames with limited joints?}

Additionally, while recording multiple people might be wrongly detected. However, in $REPLACE_OUR$ experiments $REPLACE_WE$ only consider single person recordings. Therefore, $REPLACE_WE$ can discard other people from the data.

The pseudo code for the data evaluation process can be seen in Listing \ref{lst:data_eval}. Most of the checks mentioned, such as \texttt{selectInvalidPeople} in Line 9 or \texttt{checkJointValidity} in Line 14 happen manually. However, the data processing is done automatically by the code to redue human error.

    invalid_frames = []
    for frame in recording:
      if not frame:
        invalid_frames.append(frame)
        continue
      else:
        if len(frame.people) > 1:
          invalid_people = frame.selectInvalidPeople()
          frame.remove(invalid_people)

        for joint in frame.people[0].skeleton:
          if joint.confidence < CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD:
            checkJointValidity(joint)
    
    if len(invalid_frames) > INVALID_LIMIT:
      return False
    
    recording.replace(invalid_frames, Null)

    return True
\end{lstlisting}

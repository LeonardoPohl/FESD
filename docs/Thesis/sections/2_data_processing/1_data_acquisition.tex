Different modalities were captured to create a dataset that reproduces a real-world application of human pose estimation for RGBD cameras. The different modalities are RGB data, depth data, and joint data. While the Nuitrack SDK offers to capture the data from the RGBD cameras and the joint data, the recorded files cannot, at the time of writing, be read without using the Nuitrack SDK. Therefore, FESDData, a custom RGBD+HPE capturing and labelling tool was developed. 

FESDData has two main uses which are interlocked. Firstly, it allows capturing predefined, as well as custom, exercises repeatedly automatically making the capturing experience when capturing many different actions more comfortable. Secondly, it allows reviewing and labelling the captured data with error labels. The lightweight nature of FESDData allows it to seamlessly capture both the RGBD stream and the skeleton data at the same time while ensuring a stable fast framerate. The dataset that is used by FESDModel was captured at a framerate of 30 frames per second.

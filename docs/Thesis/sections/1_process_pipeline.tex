\chapter{Process Pipeline}

The whole process of fault estimation can be seen as a pipeline. We start at the most basic starting block, the camera streams, and end at the most complex block, the fault estimation. The pipeline is shown in Figure \ref{fig:process_pipeline}. TODO Describe the pipeline in more detail.

In this chapter, we give a basic overview of the whole process. We go into more detail in the following sections.

\chapter[FESDData]{FESDData - Data Acquisition and Labelling of FESDDataset}
\label{sec:data_processing}

One of the most important aspects of machine learning is the data acquisition. In this thesis a custom tool is developed which is capapble of capturing and labelling multi-modal data. The tool is called \textbf{F}ault \textbf{E}stimator for \textbf{S}keleton \textbf{D}etection \textbf{Data} processor (FESDData). The tool is capapable of capturing RGBD data from multiple different RGBD cameras as well as pose data calculated by Nuitrack. Nuitrack which was developed by 3DiVi Inc\footnote{\url{https://nuitrack.com/}} it was chosen as the pose estimation backbone, since it provided the support of multiple different cameras as well as the ability to record the pose data simultaneously. 

Additionally to Nuitrack, FESDData is capable of calculating the pose information using OpenPose after the recording is done. This offers future support for other pose estimation backbones. However, OpenPose is not used in the scope of this thesis.

FESDData is designed to be easy to use and to require minimal setup. The tool is designed to be used by anyone and to be used without much need for setup or tweaking. It allows for the rapid capture of RGBD datasets with pre-labeling of multiple different recordings. The parameters can be adapted to capture datasets for many different application, e.g. Action detection. 

For this thesis exercises have been derived which are designed to emulate different scenarios with different difficulties. These exercises are discussed in section \ref{sec:errors}. The labelling of errors in the data requires domain specific knowledge and is therefore done manually. The resulting dataset, FESDDataset, is discussed in section \ref{sec:dataset}. It consists of the RGBD data as well as the pose data and the labels for the errors for each of the joints in the pose.

In this chapter, the approach to the design of the exercises is discussed by showing the difficulties of human pose estimation. Furthermore, the data acquisition and labelling process is discussed. Finally, the dataset is presented.

I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Dr. Erwin Bakker, who guided me throughout this thesis and allowed me to use a depth camera for the thesis. I would like to thank SilverFit for giving me the necessary insight into common errors in human pose estimation, and for allowing me to use their hardware for the collection of the dataset. Additionally, I would like to thank my friends and family who have been patient enough to listen to me talk about my thesis for the past 14 months. And I would especially like to thank my partner Maria Xiberras, who has supported me throughout this thesis, even if that meant many restless weekends and delaying our plans for longer than expected.

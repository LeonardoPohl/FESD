\section{Model evaluation}

%Finally, we evaluate our model by calculating different error metrics such as the mean absolute error, the mean squared error, and the root mean squared error. We also calculate the accuracy of the model, which is the percentage of correctly predicted faults. We also calculate the precision and recall of the model. The precision is the percentage of correctly predicted faults out of all predicted faults. The recall is the percentage of correctly predicted faults out of all faults in the data. We also calculate the F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall. The F1 score is a good indicator of the overall performance of the model.

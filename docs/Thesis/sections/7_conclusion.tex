\section{Future Work}

While we achieved a lot of things in this thesis, there is still a lot of work which we were not able to implement due to time constraints and feasibility.

\subsection{Technical Implementation}

\subsubsection{Parallelisation}

\subsubsection{Utilising compute shaders}

\subsubsection{More Cameras}

\subsection{Camera synchronisation}

\subsubsection{Recording editor}

If this were to become a genuine tool then a utility for editing the recordings and manually time synchronising multiple streams.

\section{Conclusion}

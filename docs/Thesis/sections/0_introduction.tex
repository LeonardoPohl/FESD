Human Pose estimation aims at detecting the pose or skeleton of a person based on visual information only. It finds many applications, from games to medical applications. This thesis is written in collaboration with SilverFit \footnote{\url{https://www.silverfit.com/en/}}. SilverFit develops games for rehabilitation with a special focus on geriatric patients. In their games, SilverFit uses human pose estimation to detect the pose of the player and use it to control the game to make exercise more enjoyable while promoting activity. They are interested in a fault estimation system for human pose estimation in their games. This thesis aims to develop such a fault estimation system for human pose estimation in their games.

In this chapter, we give an overview of different applications of human pose estimation and the challenges that are associated with it. We then introduce SilverFit and their desire for a fault estimation system for human pose estimation in their games. We then introduce the problem that we are trying to solve and the research question that we are trying to answer. Finally, we explore other approaches to the problem and how they differ from our approach.

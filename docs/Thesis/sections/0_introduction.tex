% general introduction to the problem
Human pose estimation, or skeleton detection, aims at detecting the pose or skeleton of a person based on visual information only. It finds many applications, from games to medical applications\cite{kumarapu2020animepose, ClinicalApplicationChen, MedicalAnimation}. However, human pose estimation is a difficult task that is prone to errors\cite{HPEIsHard}. These errors can be caused by different factors, such as the environment, the camera, and the person. These errors can cause the joints of the pose to be in the incorrect position or missing. This can cause the pose estimation to be incorrect, and therefore, the human-computer interaction will be hampered. The goal of this thesis is to develop a method that allows for the detection of these errors such that the pose information can either be improved on them or handled accordingly.

One of the limiting factors for human pose estimation is the user itself. If the posture is not as the model expects then errors might occur. This is especially true for applications that are designed for rehabilitation and exercise purposes. In these applications, the user is often elderly and has limited mobility, as is the case for games developed by SilverFit\footnote{\url{https://www.silverfit.com/en/}}. SilverFit is a serious gaming company that develops games for rehabilitation with a special focus on geriatric patients. In their games, SilverFit uses human pose estimation to detect the pose of the player and use it to control the game to make exercise more enjoyable while promoting activity. This thesis is written in collaboration with SilverFit and aims at improving human pose estimation by giving feedback on the errors in their games.

For some exercises designed by SilverFit and other companies, human pose estimation is not sufficiently reliable to create an enjoyable experience for patients in every environment. Especially sedentary exercises often cause the human pose estimation to fail or to produce unreliable results.

In this chapter, the research question that is answered in this thesis is discussed. Furthermore, the procedure with which the research question is answered is laid out. Finally, the fundamentals of human pose estimation and the metrics that are used to analyse the results are discussed, and related work is presented.


\section{Applications of human pose estimation}
% Should be in the introduction and not headers necessary
Human pose estimation finds application in many different fields. In this chapter, some of the most common applications of human pose estimation are mentioned.

\paragraph{Gaming and entertainment}

Gaming and entertainment are one of the most common applications of human pose estimation. Games can use human pose estimation in a way that makes the interaction between humans and computers very natural. One of the systems that kickstarted the use of depth cameras in games was the Xbox Kinect by Microsoft. The Kinekt used a depth camera to track the movement of the player and used this information to control the games.

However, since human pose estimation requires space and a good camera, it is not as widespread as conventional input peripherals.

\paragraph{Autonomous Driving}

Autonomous driving has been in development ever since humans replaced horses with cars\cite{OldAutoDrive}. However, the development of autonomous driving has been very slow. The main reason for this is that autonomous driving requires a lot of information about the environment. This information is usually provided by sensors that are installed in the car. However, sensors alone do not always suffice. In some cases, cars need to be able to estimate the pose of a human to make a decision. The posture of a human can be used to determine the action and therefore the future trajectory of the person. 

\paragraph{Animation}

To exactly emulate human movements in animation, animators can either manually move the joints of a digital skeleton or they can use real human\footnote{Or animal} actors to provide the movement for them. The manual creation of realistic movement is oftentimes very time-consuming and also error-prone. Therefore, animators often use real human actors to provide the movement for them. This provides animators with a skeleton and movement which is accurate and does not include human error. In large production studios, this is often done with motion capture or MoCap. 

MoCap is a technique that uses cameras to capture the movement of a human actor. The cameras are placed around the actor and record the movement of the actor. The actor usually wears a suit that is covered with markers. These markers are used to determine the position of the actor. To reduce the amount of occlusion of the markers a large number of cameras are used. This allows the cameras to capture the movement of the actor from different angles. However, this also increases the price of development. In cases where MoCap is not a viable option, animators can use human pose estimation to estimate the pose of a human actor using cheaper RGB cameras or RGB-D cameras.

\paragraph{Security}

Another application of human pose estimation is the detection of anomalous behaviour. The detection of such behaviour can be used to prevent security incidents in public spaces.

\paragraph{Healthcare}

To aid in the rehabilitation of patients as well as to improve the quality of life of elderly people, human pose estimation can be used to detect the pose of a person and provide feedback on the pose of the person during exercises.\cite{ClinicalApplicationChen}

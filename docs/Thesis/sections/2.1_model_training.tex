\section{Model training}

Using this enlarged dataset, we can train a Neural Network to recognise faults in the data. We use the depth data as input, the skeleton data as input, and a combination of both as input. We also experiment with different network layouts, such as a fully connected network, a convolutional network, and a combination of both. We use the augmented data to train the model and the manually checked ground truth to validate the model. We use the validation data to determine the best model and the best network layout. We use the best model to predict the faults in the data.
